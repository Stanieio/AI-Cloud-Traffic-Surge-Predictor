📌 Project Overview

This project predicts cloud traffic spikes before they occur using a deep learning LSTM model and simulates intelligent auto-scaling decisions.

The system is designed to mimic how modern cloud platforms handle sudden traffic surges during:

E-commerce sales
Ticket booking events
Streaming releases
Unexpected traffic attacks

🧠 Key Features

-> 📊 Realistic traffic simulation (daily + weekly patterns + surge spikes)
->🤖 LSTM-based time series forecasting
->⚠ Surge detection logic
->⚙ Auto-scaling decision engine
->🌐 API integration (FastAPI)
->📈 Interactive dashboard
->☁ Cloud deployment ready

🏗 System Architecture

Traffic Data → LSTM Prediction → Surge Detection → Scaling Engine → API → Dashboard


🛠 Tech Stack

->Python
->TensorFlow (LSTM)
->Pandas & NumPy
->Matplotlib
->FastAPI
->Git & GitHub

🎯 Objective

To build a smart AI system that predicts traffic spikes and helps cloud systems scale resources efficiently before overload happens.
