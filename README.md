📌 Project Overview

This project predicts cloud traffic spikes before they occur using a deep learning LSTM model and simulates intelligent auto-scaling decisions.

The system is designed to mimic how modern cloud platforms handle sudden traffic surges during:

E-commerce sales

Ticket booking events

Streaming releases

Unexpected traffic attacks
